= Overview

[big]#*This Documentation is still under development and probably incomplete and/or flawed in certain areas.*#

== HTTP verbs

The Taskana RESTful API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update a resource

| `DELTE`
| Used to delete a existing resource
|===

== HTTP status codes

The Taskana RESTful API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully.

| `201 Created`
| The request completed successfully und create the new resource.

| `202 Accepted`
| The request could not be processed immediatly but will be carried out later.

| `204 No Content` 
| The request completed successfully and there is no content to send in the response payload.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was not performed because of a client error like a invalid parameter.

| `401 Unauthorized`
| The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.

| `403 FORBIDDEN`
| The current user <user> has no read permission for <Resource Type> <Resource>.

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist.

| `405 Method not allowed`
| The method used in this request is can not be used on this resource.

| `406` Not acceptable
| Wrong content-type in request header.

| `409 Conflict`
| The resource could not be updatet or created because of a conflict with an existing one.

| `415 Unsupported Media Type`
| The content of the request can't be understood due to being in an unsupported media-type.

| `423 Locked`
| The resource is currently locked and cannot be modified.
|===

== Common Fields

Taskana uses Spring HATEOAS to achive the best possible REST-conformity. +
In HATEOAS every response contains a map named *_links* in which the links for navigation are included. +
If a resource has embedded resources these are found in a map named *_embedded*.

=== Response Fields common to all Resources

Every Resource contains at least the link to itself.

include::{snippets}/CommonFields/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Response Fields common to all Summary Resources

Summary Resources contain embedded resources and can be requested in a <<paged-request, paged format>>.

include::{snippets}/CommonSummaryResourceFields/response-fields.adoc[]

== Tasks-Resource

=== Get a list of all tasks

A `GET` request is used to retrieve a task summary.

==== Example Request

include::{snippets}/GetAllTasksDocTest/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example Response

include::{snippets}/GetAllTasksDocTest/http-response.adoc[]

==== Response Structure

include::{snippets}/GetAllTasksDocTest/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Filter and sort options

The list generated in the response can be filtered using following parameters in the uri: +
name | priority | state | classification.key | workbasket-id | {workbasket-key , domain} | +
owner | por.company | por.system | por.instance | por.type | por.value +
planned | planned-from | planned-until | due | due-from | due-until | +
external-id | wildcard-search-value | wildcard-search-fields

When filtering a wildcard search you must provide both paremters +
(wildcard-search-value and wildcard-search-fields). Valid wildcard-search-fields are: +

-name +
-description +
-custom_1 to custom_16 +

These fields are case insensitive! +

If it is sufficient to filter the list with a single time interval, use the parameters +
planned-from/due-from and planned-until/due-until. +
Leave one of them out of the request, if you want to have an open interval. +

If it is required to filter the list with multiple planned or due time intervals, the parameters +
 planned / due can be used as follows instead: +

 - provide a string with an even number of instants separated by a ",". Time intervals will be +
 determined in pairs of those instants. +

 - in case of a required open interval, just give one of the arguments of the pair an empty string +
 like this: +

 planned = {Instant1},{Instant2},,{Instant3} this will create two intervals, one between Instant1 +
 and Instant2 as well as an open interval between the beginning of time and Instant3 +

 Note that it is prohibited to use the planned / due parameter in combination with the +
 planned-from/due-from and/or planned-until/due-until parameters +

It can also be sorted by using this set of parameters: +
sortBy = { classification.key | por.type | por.value | state | name| due | planned | priority } | order={ desc | asc }
