= Overview

[big]#*This Documentation is still under development and probably incomplete and/or flawed in certain areas.*#

== HTTP verbs

The Taskana RESTful API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update a resource

| `DELTE`
| Used to delete a existing resource
|===

== HTTP status codes

The Taskana RESTful API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully.

| `201 Created`
| The request completed successfully und create the new resource.

| `204 No Content` 
| The request completed successfully and there is no content to send in the response payload.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was not performed because of a client error like a invalid parameter.

| `401 Unauthorized`
| The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.

| `403 FORBIDDEN`
| The current user <user> has no read permission for <Resource Type> <Resource>.

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist.

| `405 Method not allowed`
| The method used in this request is can not be used on this resource.

| `406` Not acceptable

== Common Fields

Taskana uses Spring HATEOAS to achive the best possible REST-conformity. +
In HATEOAS every response contains a map named *_links* in which the links for navigation are included. +
If a resource has embedded resources these are found in a map named *_embedded*.

=== Response Fields common to all Resources

Every Resource contains at least the link to itself.

include::../../../{snippets}/CommonFields/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Response Fields common to all Summary Resources

Summary Resources contain embedded resources and can be requested in a <<paged-request, paged format>>.

include::../../../{snippets}/CommonSummaryResourceFields/response-fields.adoc[]

== Classifications-Resource

This resource provides the entry point with classifications.

=== Get a list of all classifications

A `GET` request is used to retrieve a classification summary.

==== Example Response

include::../../../{snippets}/GetAllClassificationsDocTest/http-response.adoc[]

==== Response Structure

include::../../../{snippets}/GetAllClassificationsDocTest/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Filter and sort options

The list generated in the response can be filtered using following parameters in the uri: +
name | name-like | key | category | domain | type | custom-{1...8}-like +

It can also be sorted by using this set of parameters: +
sortBy = {category | domain | key | name } | order={desc | asc }
