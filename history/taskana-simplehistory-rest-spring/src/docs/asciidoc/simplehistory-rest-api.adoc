= TASKANA History module RESTful API Documentation

== Overview
This is the REST documentation for http://taskana.pro)[TASKANA]'s simplehistory REST endpoints.

*For all Query Parameters:* whenever a parameter is an array type, several values can be passed by declaring that parameter multiple times.

=== Hypermedia Support

NOTE: HATEOAS support is still in development.
Please have a look at example responses for each resource to determine the available links.

TASKANA uses the https://restfulapi.net/hateoas/)[HATEOAS] (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) REST constraint.
Most of our resources contain a `_links` section which contains navigation links.
Besides, helping to navigate through our REST API, the navigation links also encapsulate the API.
Using HATEOAS allows us to change some endpoints without modifying your frontend.
