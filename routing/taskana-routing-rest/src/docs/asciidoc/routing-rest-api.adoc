= TASKANA RESTful API Documentation

== Overview

This is the REST documentation for http://taskana.pro)[TASKANA]'s routing REST endpoints.

*For all Query Parameters:* +
Whenever a parameter is an array type, several values can be passed by declaring that parameter multiple times.


Whenever a parameter is a complex type, the attributes of the value-object can be passed as a json.
For example, a complex parameter with the name "complex-query-param" and attributes "attribute1" and "attribute2"
would be specified in the following way: +
complex-query-param={"attribute1":"value1","attribute2":"value2"}

=== Hypermedia Support

NOTE: HATEOAS support is still in development.
Please have a look at example responses for each resource to determine the available links.

TASKANA uses the https://restfulapi.net/hateoas/)[HATEOAS] (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) REST constraint.
Most of our resources contain a `_links` section which contains navigation links.
Besides, helping to navigate through our REST API, the navigation links also encapsulate the API.
Using HATEOAS allows us to change some endpoints without modifying your frontend.

=== Errors

In order to support multilingual websites, TASKANA uses error codes to define which error occurred.
Additionally, an optional set of message variables, containing some technical information, is added, so that the website can describe the error with all details.
