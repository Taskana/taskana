== Database Configuration

Taskana uses a database to persist the managed entities.
When creating this database, you should consider the following items:

* We recommend to create the database with a page size of 32 k
* Be aware that the sort order of query results is governed by the collation sequence that is specified at database creation.
The default for the most databases is a case sensitive sort order.
If you want query results to be sorted case insensitively, you should specify an appropriate collation sequence.

For DB2, a database create command with case insensitive collation would be

```Sql
CREATE DATABASE <dbname> USING CODESET UTF-8 TERRITORY <territory> COLLATE USING 'CLDR181_LDE_AS_CX_EX_FX_HX_NX_S3' PAGESIZE 32 K <additional parameters>
```

The database schema can be changed by setting the parameter `taskana.schema` in the
`application.properties` file.
This applies to Spring environments, only.

Taskana connects to the database via a DataSource.
It does not support XADataSources for connections to databases.

== TASKANA Configuration

Taskana is configured via a configuration file `taskana.properties`.
This configuration file contains all parameters to control the behaviour of the taskana library.

=== General Parameter

|===
|Parameter |Description |Sample Value

|`taskana.domains`
|The pipe separated list of administrative domains
|DOMAIN_A, DOMAIN_B

|`taskana.classification.types`
|The pipe separated list of classification types
|TASK, DOCUMENT

|`taskana.classification.categories`
|The pipe separated list of classification categories
|EXTERNAL, MANUAL, AUTOMATIC, PROCESS

|`taskana.user.minimalPermissionsToAssignDomains`
|The list of minimal Workbasket permissions of a user needed to belong to the domain. Needed to
determine the domains of a user, which are aggregated in the getUser() method of the UserService.
Values have to match the Enum values of <<Workbasket Permissions>>. If this property is not
defined, the dynamic computation of the `domain` attribute will not be executed.

The permission READ always needs to be set, as itâ€™s required for a user to see the Workbasket.
|READ, OPEN
|===

=== Security Configuration

The properties file contains the specification of the lists of access ids (i.e. users or groups) that belong to the roles user, business_admin or admin.

The keywords to specify these roles are as follows:

|===
|Parameter |Description |Sample Value

|`taskana.roles.user`
|The USER role grants access to Taskana. USER is everybody who gets assigned to and completes tasks.
|`cn=ksc-users,cn=groups,OU=Test,O=TASKANA \| teamlead-1 \| teamlead-2 \| user-1-1`

|`taskana.roles.business_admin`
|The BUSINESS_ADMINISTRATOR role allows to change the business configuration (workbaskets,
classifications, ...)
|`businessadmin \| cn=business-admins,cn=groups,OU=Test,O=TASKANA`

|`taskana.roles.admin`
|The ADMINISTRATOR role includes all permissions on the system.
|`admin \| uid=admin,cn=users,OU=Test,O=TASKANA`

|`taskana.roles.monitor`
|The MONITOR role grants access to all monitoring operations and to the monitoring UI.
|`monitor \| cn=monitor-users,cn=groups,OU=Test,O=TASKANA`

|`taskana.roles.task_admin`
|The TASK_ADMIN role includes all permissions on tasks with the exception of deleting a task/tasks.
It can also READ all workbaskets in case to create/transfer tasks in/to them.
|`task_admin`

|`taskana.roles.task_router`
|The TASK_ROUTER role is a technical role which allows creation of tasks in all workbaskets.
(Skips permission check during creation)
|`task_router`
|===

Each entry may contain a list of access ids that are separated by the '|' character.
Whitespace at the begin or end of each access id is ignored.

By default, this configuration file has the name 'taskana.properties' and is searched in the classpath.
In addition, the separator '|' is used.
Both defaults can be changed by specifying the property filename and separator explicitly when creating the TaskanaEngineConfiguration via constructor.

```Java
 TaskanaEngineConfiguration(DataSource dataSource, boolean useManagedTransactions,
        boolean securityEnabled, String propertiesFileName, String propertiesSeparator)
```

If in this call, either propertiesFileName or propertiesSeparator is null, Taskana uses the default value.

If for example, you want Taskana to use the 'application.properties' file from the classpath, you should specify "/application.properties" as propertiesFileName.

You may also specify a fully qualified filename that addresses a file directly.
In this case, that file is not searched on the classpath but loaded by its name.

Please note, that if you specify a non-default propertiesSeparator, the access ids must not contain any character that is contained in this propertiesSeparator.

If Taskana doesn't find a configuration file, it operates with empty roles.

=== Holidays

|===
|Parameter |Description |Sample Value

|`taskana.workingTime.holidays.german.enabled`
|When set to true, German public Holidays (like eastermonday) are enabled.
|`true`

|`taskana.workingTime.holidays.german.corpus-christi.enabled`
|When set to true, corpus christi is a public holiday too
|`true`

|`taskana.workingTime.holidays.custom`
|Allows to set dates as holiday. The format of an Holiday is in the format of `dd.MM` where `dd`
stand for day and `MM` stand for month. The single custom holidays have to be separated by either
by the default separator \|
|`31.07\|16.12`
|===

=== Working time configuration

Via the property `taskana.workingtime.schedule` you are able to specify the schedule of your working time.

[TIP]
If there is no such property, the default value of Taskana takes care that working day calculation happens as before (assuming your Timezone is Europe/Berlin).
This means there is no reconfiguration of Service Levels and similar things necessary.

* You can have multiple working slots per day separated by `|`

* The precision is up to you.
You can theoretically specify nanoseconds if you want to.
But typically minutes is the highest precision you will need.
The full format is documented by
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalTime.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-[LocalTime of the Java SDK]

|===
|Paramter |Description |Sample Value

|`taskana.workingtime.schedule.monday`
|Defines the working hours for monday.
|`07:00-12:00\|13:00-18:00`

|`taskana.workingtime.schedule.tuesday`
|Defines the working hours for tuesday.
|`07:00-12:00\|13:00-18:00`

|`taskana.workingtime.schedule.wednesday`
|Defines the working hours for wednesday.
|`07:00-12:00\|13:00-18:00`

|`taskana.workingtime.schedule.thursday`
|Defines the working hours for thursday.
|`07:00-12:00\|13:00-18:00`

|`taskana.workingtime.schedule.friday`
|Defines the working hours for friday.
|`07:00-12:00\|13:00-18:00`

|`taskana.workingtime.schedule.saturday`
|Defines the working hours for saturday.
|`07:00-12:00`

|`taskana.workingtime.schedule.sunday`
|Defines the working hours for sunday.
|`13:00-18:00`

|`taskana.workingtime.timezone`
|specify the time zone that is used in to calculate working time. The format of the possible values
is documented by https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html#of-java.lang.String-[ZoneId of the Java SDK].
We generally recommend to use region Ids.

The default value is `Europe/Berlin`.
|`America/Phoenix`
|===

=== History deletion upon task deletion

By adding the property `taskana.history.simple.deleteOnTaskDeletion.enabled` to the `taskana.properties`
file the history deletion upon task deletion can be activated.
If activated all history events concerning the deleted task/s will also be deleted

=== History audit logger

By adding the property `taskana.history.logger.name` it is possible to configure the name of the logger which you want to use to write to your audit file.
Furthermore you can configure the audit logger through a custom log4j.xml file.

Example

```
taskana.historylogger.name=AUDIT
```

=== DMN Task router

The location of the DMN file which you would like to use for routing rules is configurable.
The Router will first check if a file exists in the filesystem for the provided value and if that's not the case it will check the classpath.
You have to specify the location/path by adding the
`taskana.routing.dmn` property.

Example

```
taskana.routing.dmn=/dmn-routing.dmn
```

=== Validation of timestamps with a service level mismatch

The `taskana.servicelevel.validation.enforce` allows the user to create tasks with timestamps that do not match i.e. exceed the service level of the classification.
If the property is set to `true`, the planned and due timestamp of a Task can be set to points in time, which are further apart than the service level of the classification would normally allow.

=== Additional User Info

If you are using the USER_INFO table you can add the Full/Long name when retrieveing Tasks/TaskComments/TaskHistoryEvents with the property `taskana.user.addAdditionalUserInfo`

== LDAP Configuration

TASKANA uses a number of properties to enable the out-of-the-box integration with a LDAP server.
These properties are described here.

As the LDAP integration is part of the REST API, which is based on Spring, the LDAP properties have to be placed in the `application.properties` file, *not* in the `taskana.properties`.

|===

== AdminUI Configuration

=== REST API Configuration

The REST Endpoint for the Frontend application can be configured using a JSON file.
That JSON file has to be served at `/environments/data-sources/environment-information.json` and will be loaded *on initial request*.

The `environment-information.json` contains two configurations:

|===
|Parameter |Description |Sample Value

|`taskanaRestUrl`
|The root path of the REST Service. Please note that you have append  `/api` . Otherwise the
Frontend application will not find the REST Service.
|`http://localhost:8080/taskana/api`

|`taskanaLogoutUrl`
|The location a user is redirected to when a logout is triggered.
|`http://localhost:8080/taskana/logout`
|===

The default https://github.com/Taskana/taskana/blob/master/web/src/environments/data-sources/environment-information.json[environment-information.json]
file can be found in our GitHub repository.

=== UI Customization

Some TASKANA UI elements, such as custom properties, can be configured using a JSON file.
That json file has to be served at `/environments/data-sources/taskana-customization.json` and will be loaded
*on initial request*.

The default https://github.com/Taskana/taskana/blob/master/web/src/environments/data-sources/taskana-customization.json[taskana-customization.json]
will be found in our GitHub repository.

If you have any questions regarding the UI Customization, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.

=== How to serve configuration files

There are multiple ways to serve these configuration files.
Our example project showcases two:

. Using the `/static` folder in order to serve a static file.

. Using a REST Controller in order to serve a static file.

Our example project serves the `environment-information.json` using the `/static` folder.
Here is a link to the repository: https://github.com/Taskana/taskana/tree/master/rest/taskana-rest-spring-example-common/src/main/resources/static/environments/data-sources

In our example the `taskana-customization.json` is served via a https://github.com/Taskana/taskana/blob/master/rest/taskana-rest-spring-example-common/src/main/java/pro/taskana/example/rest/controllers/ResourcesController.java[REST Controller].
This allows further customization.
E.g. Based on some environment properties you can serve a different
`taskana-customization.json`.
This can be done programmatically within the REST Controller.

== Security Roles in TASKANA

Taskana distinguishes between five different roles:

* USER
+
The USER role grants access to Taskana. USER is everybody who gets assigned to and completes tasks.
* TASK_ADMIN
+
The TASK_ADMIN role includes all permissions on tasks with the exception of deleting a task/tasks.
It can also READ all workbaskets in case to create/transfer tasks in/to them.
* BUSINESS_ADMINISTRATOR
+
The BUSINESS_ADMINISTRATOR role allows to change the business configuration (workbaskets,
classifications, ...)
* ADMINISTRATOR
+
The ADMINISTRATOR role includes all permissions on the system.
* MONITOR
+
The MONITOR role grants access to all monitoring operations and to the monitoring UI.

Since Taskana is based on JAAS, it provides a basic role mapping for Principals to roles. This
is configured in the TaskanaEngineConfiguration. You can assign a list of Principal names to each
role. Taskana will check if one of the user principals is contained in the required role.

== Workbasket Permissions

Taskana allows for a fine grained access control to Workbaskets. This is done by maintaining an access control list for each Workbasket. An access control list item grants a set of permissions to an access id (JAAS principial, user or group).

The following permissions are available:


|===
|Permission|Meaning

|READ
|Read or query Workbasket metadata and its containing Tasks.

If a user does *not* have the READ permission, he does not even know about the existence of the
Workbasket.

If a user does *not* have the READ permission, he canâ€™t see the Tasks within that Workbasket.

|OPEN
|The user is allowed to *explicitly* query the Tasks of *specific* Workbaskets.

If a user does *not* have the OPEN permission, he canâ€™t query/filter Tasks by Workbaskets.

|APPEND
|The user is allowed to append a Task to the Workbasket. This applies to creation of Tasks in this
Workbasket as well as for transferring Tasks to this Workbasket.

|TRANSFER
|Allows the user to transfer Tasks from this Workbasket to another one.

|DISTRIBUTE
|The user is allowed to distribute Tasks from this Workbasket to the configured distribution
targets. For distribution the APPEND and TRANSFER permissions are checked also.

|CUSTOM_1 .. CUSTOM_12
|Permissions to be used in custom code to configure application specific scenarios which are not
directly checked by TASKANA.
